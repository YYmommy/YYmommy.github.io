      <description>In This Is Us, Jack took a video when Kate was singing. Kate got very angry. Jack said that he just want her to know how beautiful she is in his eyes. After Kate watched that video, she told Jack:
Never stop. Never stop trying to let me know how beautiful I am in your eyes.
This reminds me of a conversation between you and me when you tried medication. You expected me to persuade you.</description>
